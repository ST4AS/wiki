# Shell Access to running instance

## Access

You can access the shell instance via Web Terminal by clicking in the Chip logo in your stack dashboard


## Note
- Because of our stack security, each shell session with automatically end per 30 minutes
- Some minor stack/container would not support shell access (such as "Scratch" due to the minimum build of docker context without any Shell programs), but most of them are, as of they're based on Alpine Linux
