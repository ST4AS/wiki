# Getting Started with Staas.io

This section of the Staas.io docs is all about getting you up and running quickly.

Follow Hands-on tutorials which takes you through creating an account, creating a new stack and launching a simple demo app:
- [Launching a Python stack]({% link docs/getting-started/intro-python.md %})
- [Launching a WordPress stack]({% link docs/getting-started/intro-wordpress.md %})
- [Launching a NodeJS stack]({% link docs/getting-started/intro-nodejs.md %})

<!-- If you’d rather jump right in, try [Speedrun]() to launch your own app fast. -->

Once that’s done, check out our in-depth docs:
